# Multiomics Integration via Deep Archetypal Analysis (MIDAA)

MIDAA is a package designed for performing Deep Archetypal Analysis on multiomics data. The documentation can be find here [https://sottorivalab.github.io/midaa/](https://sottorivalab.github.io/midaa/)

*The package is under active development, expect breaking changes (we just changed the tool name ;) ) and incomplete documentation for a bit*
*I'll try my best to speed this up, if something is broken or you need help please open an issue, do not be shy!*

## Installation

```bash
# Better to do this in a virtual or conda env, here I'll go with conda
# As for some packages there is still no wheel I suggest stick with python 3.11 or 3.12
conda create -n MIDAA python=3.11
conda activate MIDAA
pip install poetry 
# Soon on pypi
git clone https://github.com/sottorivalab/midaa.git
cd midaa
# you need poetry installed
poetry install
# or 
poetry build
pip install dist/*.whl

```

## Quick Start


midaa encodes you multi-modal data into a latent simplex: 

$$
\mathbf{Z^*} =   \mathbf{A}  \mathbf{B}  \mathbf{Z} 
$$


midaa leans the matrices $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$ in an amortized fashion, namely we learn a function that takes in input the different data modalities $\mathbf{X_g}$ indexed by $g$ and learns the 3 matrices. As you could have got from the name, we parametrize the function as a neural network. 
The network is implemented in a Variational Autoencdoer fashion, so we have and encoding and decoding function as well as probabilistic definition of the matrix factorization problem above.
Both the encoder and the decoder have a shared portion where data fusion occurs and an independent piece where modality specific encoding and decoding takes place.

If you are happy with that we have some cool tutorials that will show you how to use MIDAA on real [multi-omics data](https://sottorivalab.github.io/midaa/scMulti_multimodal.html).

Otherwise, the best way to start is to read [this](https://sottorivalab.github.io/midaa/midaa_long_form.html) or the companion [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.05.588238v1) and understand what MIDAA actually does in details and what are the [parameters](https://sottorivalab.github.io/midaa/implementation_and_parameters.html) you can play with.


A minimal example to run the tool:

```python

import midaa as maa
import scanpy as sc

adata =  sc.datasets.pbmc3k_processed()
input_matrix, norm_factors, input_distribution = maa.get_input_params_adata(adata)

narchetypes = 5

aa_result = maa.fit_MIDAA(
    input_matrix,
    norm_factors,
    input_distribution,
    narchetypes = narchetypes
    )


```
